# python-and-flask
These were more early Springboard online bootcamp projects, generally dealing with basic python and flask.
They were all done around October/November of 2020. Some can function in browser as is; most include requirements.txt file. 
As with most Springboard projects, they were completed as assignments and generally only meet the specified requirements, thus they may be unpolished and not handle all potential errors (Boggle is probably the most polished example in this folder).
